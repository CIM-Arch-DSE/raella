#    1) Change USER_UID and USER_GID to the desired owner of your files (echo $UID )
#    2) Run the following command:
#
#        % If you are using x86 CPU (Intel, AMD)
#        % DOCKER_ARCH=amd64 docker-compose up
#
#        % If you want to avoid typing "DOCKER_ARCH=" every time,
#        % "export DOCKER_ARCH=<your architecture>" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
#
#    5) Look at output and use the 127.0.0.1 URL (unless you changed the port below)
